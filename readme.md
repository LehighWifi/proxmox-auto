This is a simple python app to generate the toml answer file for proxmox. It utilizes a basic template and updates the FQDN based on the requested host number (pvex) 

I used DNS to opt 250 to automate which host recieved which file. 

this would be easy to expand to cover other drive filters or network adjustments as well
